Welcome to Cricket Fever! The goal of the game is to win coins. All your coins add up to give you a place on the leaderboard. To win coins, you can play cricket trivia or predict the result of the upcoming cricket match!

In cricket trivia, I will ask you a random question. For every right answer, you get 1 coin. You have to respond with the number of the answer. For example, say one, two, three, or four.

While for the game prediction game, I will tell you about an upcoming match between Team A and Team B. You will wager 10 coins to predict the result. You win 20 coins for a correct prediction and lose 10 coins for a wrong prediction. To make a prediction, you just say either Team A or Team B. You can say skip if you don't want to make any predictions and go back to the dashboard.

For the database, we are using Google Sheets: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XU_hEaU_g_hhHLA254WQ5OmsUcoGOc9Of2UfqbVlj4Y/edit?usp=sharing

We are running a Flask App that allows a player to view the dynamic global leaderboard. It also continously polls the database and the Cricket API to view the match result and update the coins of the participants automatically. After the updation, it fetches new upcoming match details and updates the database. The code for the Flask app can be accessed through: https://github.com/hannansatopay/Cricket-Fever

The Cricket API being utilized for fetching the match results: https://rapidapi.com/dev132/api/cricket-live-scores
