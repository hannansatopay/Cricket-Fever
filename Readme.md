Welcome to Cricket Fever! The goal of the game is to win coins. All your coins add up to give you a place on the leaderboard. To win coins, you can play cricket trivia or predict the result of the upcoming cricket match!

In cricket trivia, I will ask you a random question. For every right answer, you get 1 coin. You have to respond with the number of the answer. For example, say one, two, three, or four.

While for the game prediction game, I will tell you about an upcoming match between Team A and Team B. You will wager 10 coins to predict the result. You win 20 coins for a correct prediction and lose 10 coins for a wrong prediction. To make a prediction, you just say either Team A or Team B. You can say skip if you don't want to make any predictions and go back to the dashboard.
